In this project, a distributed social network was developed, inspired by the architecture of Mastodon. The network is composed of a set of independent servers, often referred to as "domains" within Mastodon terminology.

### User Accounts and Interaction

Each user creates an account on a specific domain, granting them the ability to interact not only with other users on the same domain but also with users on different domains. While each domain manages its own user profiles and data, users can seamlessly engage with others across the entire network.

### Profile Management and Message Feed

Users have the ability to manage and update their own profiles. Each user also has a personalized message feed, where they can post new content. These posts are visible to the userâ€™s followers and can be retrieved at any time.

### Cross-Domain Interaction

One of the key features of this network is the ability for users to follow and interact with users on different domains. When a user subscribes to someone from another domain, the request is sent through the user's home domain, ensuring that interactions remain decentralized and managed locally. This cross-domain interaction makes the network both flexible and scalable, as users are not limited to a single domain for communication.
