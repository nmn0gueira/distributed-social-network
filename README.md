This project implements a distributed social network inspired by Mastodon's architecture. It consists of multiple independent servers, called "domains," where users can create accounts and interact both locally and across domains.

Users can manage their profiles, update content, and post to their personal message feed, which is visible to their followers. Additionally, users can follow and engage with others on different domains, ensuring decentralized and scalable communication.
